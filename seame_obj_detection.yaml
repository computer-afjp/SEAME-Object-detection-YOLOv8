    The dataset is split into three subsets:

    Train: This subset contains 100k images for training object detection, segmentation, and captioning models.
    Val: This subset has 20k images used for validation purposes during model training.
    Minival: This subset is exactly the same as COCO val2017 set which has 5k images used for validation purposes during model training.
    Test: This subset consists of 20k images used for testing and benchmarking the trained models. 
          Ground truth annotations for this subset are not publicly available, and the results are submitted to the LVIS evaluation server for performance evaluation.
